# DJango Blog CMS

	Welcome. DJBlog is a very special project to me. 
	Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, 
	and together we create something beautiful that I&#8217;m proud to be a part of.

## Install
	
	1º) Python >= 3.x
	2º) Install pymysql with pip3
	3º) Create database django_blog in phpmyadmin using XAMPP for example.
	4º) Migrate model to SQL Database
	5º) python3 migrate.py runserver

	That´s all!
